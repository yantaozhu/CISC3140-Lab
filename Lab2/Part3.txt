I am working on a group of 3 for the group project. We work together by have meeting on Zoom when working on the project. During our first meeting, we all looking at the dataset we want to do on our own and then share the dataset with each other to find a single dataset that we want to use for the project. We are going with the dataset that contain data on car crashes in NYC. Then we brainstorm question that we can answer with the dataset and choice five that we think are the most easiest to work with.
On our second meeting, I share my screen with other group members and start write our first awk program that will answer our first question. We were have difficult time figure the first program since we all are unfamiliar with awk. But with some reading on the GNU Awk Manual and some research online, we were able to write out our first program. Then we encounter some problem on the second question since some of the output isn't a part of the output we expected. After a long time of try and error, we realize that the problem is formate of the dataset we used. We are using the CSV file at first, which have comma as the field separator. However, one of the column in our dataset contain data that have comma, which cause some of the data to be in the wrong location. So we change to TSV file, where the field separator is tab. Then everything seem to be working until when we sort the output. For some reason, the output is separator into two part where one part is sorted one way and the second part is sorted differently. We have try multiple way to fix it, but we always got the same output. So we just skip the second question and working on the rest. There is no trouble when we working with the rest of the question and we basically use a similiar code as the first question, but with some value changed. At the end, I add all the awk programs and the dataset to the GitHub repository and push it to main.
