Java and Bash are very different programming languages. In this lab, I was create program in both Java and Bash that will take the two date from the input and print out the number of days between those two days. While using Java, I have to import Java time library and Java scanner library. I need the time library in my program since it will allow me to store date as a value and do math on them. The scanner library is needed to receive input from the user, there is not way to get input from user without scanner. In most of the Java program, library is a must. On the other head, bash script can run most of the program by themself. 
The Java program and Bash script I wrote for the lab follows the same idea. However there are many thing I use in my Java program that I was unable to recreate in the Bash script. An example would be the try and catch in Java. In the Java code, I was able to use try and catch to catch any time where the user input an invalid input and ask the user to input again until the input is accepted. In Bash script, there is not command like try and catch that I can use to check if the user input an invalid input. Once there is an invalid input, the Bash script will not be able to handle it and just give error as output. Because I have the try and catch command in the Java program and not in Bash script, the Java program has more line than the Bash script.
