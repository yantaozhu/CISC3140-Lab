Shell script and makefile are both difficult to understand for me. I have to do research outside of the manual in order to complete them. Additionally I was unable to find a way to use file as an input for the Java program in makefile. Bash script are different from makefile since you can use bash script as a programming language while makefile can not. Bash script and makefile are similar because they both can divided a large program into smaller parts, like function in Bash script and task in makefile. I feel like using Bash script is easier for me since I can applied some of my knowledge from Java and C++ when with Bash script. On the other hand, I have no knowledge on how to use and create makefile before working on this lab.
